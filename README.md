# CodeAndConquer – DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my consistent practice of Data Structures
and Algorithms using C++.  
I solve problems daily, mainly from LeetCode, while following a
following a structured DSA curriculum and solving problems
regularly from platforms like LeetCode
for structured learning.

The goal of this repository is to build strong problem-solving skills,
maintain clean code organization, and track my long-term DSA progress.

2. 2D Arrays  
3. Strings  
4. Pointers  
5. Time & Space Complexity  
6. Recursion  
7. Backtracking  
8. Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)  
9. Linked List  
10. Stacks  
11. Queues  
12. Deque

14. Binary Search Tree (BST)  
15. Heaps / Priority Queue  
16. Hashing  
17. Graphs  
18. Greedy Algorithms  
19. Dynamic Programming

21. Segment Trees

## Repository Structure

- Each topic has its own folder.
- Problems inside a topic are ordered numerically.
- Each solution is written in *C++*.
- Topic-wise README.md files explain the problems covered.

## Practice Approach

- Solve problems daily (mainly from LeetCode).
- Focus on understanding logic and patterns.
- Maintain clean, readable, and well-named files.
- Gradually move from Easy to Medium and Hard problems.

## Language Used
- C++

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A personal learning tracker
- A structured DSA revision resource
- A showcase of consistent problem-solving for placements
